Hello! Here is Shangzhe Li, an undergraduate student from South China University of Technology. I'm an aviation enthusiast, a Physics & Mathematics lover and also a student majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My hometown is Guangzhou. I usually live stream on Bilibili and post articles on Zhihu. I'm an anime lover.

My research interest includes reinforcement learning and generative models. I haven't published any papers yet but I'm trying my best in the research.
