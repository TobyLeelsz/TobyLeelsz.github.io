Hello! I‚Äôm Shangzhe Li, a Ph.D. student at UNC Chapel Hill, where I'm fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Weitong Zhang](https://zeroweight.github.io/). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) at the University of California, San Diego. Previously, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Marco Caccamo](https://rtsl.cps.mw.tum.de/personal_page/mcaccamo/) and [Prof. Nils Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/about/n-thuerey/) at the Technical University of Munich, as well as with [Prof. Xinhua Zhang](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~zhangx/) at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

I'm passionate about aviation, Physics, and Mathematics, and I‚Äôm pursuing my studies in Artificial Intelligence. My hometown is Guangzhou. In my free time, I enjoy live streaming on Bilibili, sharing insights on Zhihu, and indulging in my love for anime.  

My research interests lie broadly in the fields of reinforcement learning and imitation learning, with a focus on both algorithmic design and practical applications:

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: I‚Äôm interested in developing novel reinforcement learning algorithms powered by deep neural networks to tackle complex decision-making problems. Lately, I‚Äôve been particularly focused on model-based RL.

- **Imitation Learning**: I explore new approaches to imitation learning, especially adversarial imitation learning in complex, high-dimensional environments. I‚Äôm also excited about leveraging large foundation models within imitation learning frameworks.

- **Theoretical Foundations of RL/IL**: I aim to better understand the theoretical underpinnings of reinforcement and imitation learning, with the goal of using theory to inform and inspire more effective algorithmic designs.

- **Applications in LLM Post-training and Robot Learning**: I‚Äôm interested in applying RL to enhance large language model post-training (e.g., alignment, distillation, and reasoning), as well as to solve challenging robotic control problems in manipulation and locomotion.
